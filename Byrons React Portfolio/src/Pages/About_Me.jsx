        <h2>About Me</h2>
      
        <p>Hello! I'm Byron Tobe, im a dedicated and motivated beginner making an exciting transition into web development. I've always enjoyed problem-solving and working with technology. However, I wanted to take my passion for tech even furtherâ€”so I decided to dive into web development.
  
  Currently, I'm enrolled in a web development bootcamp, where I'm getting a grap on the fundementals of JavaScript, React, Node.js, and modern front-end and back-end technologies. Through hands-on projects, I've developed skills in building dynamic applications, responsive design, and problem-solving with code.
  <br></br><br></br>
  One of my favorite aspects of coding is the challenge it provides and the satisfaction that comes with a job well done. 
  As I continue to grow as a developer, I'm eager to work on real-world projects, collaborate with other developers, and refine my skills in full-stack development.
  
  My goal is to leverage my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and technical knowledge to transition into a career as a web developer. I'm excited about the journey ahead and always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and connect with other developers.
  
  Let's climb this mountain together and become better web developers!</p>
